[WHAT DID YOU DO?]


__1/8/20__ Emma:

Realized new method will still not mimic the Mario Kart physics properly. Completely rewrote again using the vectors file added by Greg, combined with the first method.


__1/7/20__ TEAM:

We each played a round of Mario Kart to get a feel of the game and discussed how we could implement basic features.


__1/6/20__ Emma:

Realized current method of physics will not work. Rewrote into a completely new method. Added cases handling for physics.


__1/5/20__ Emma:

Fixed up errors found in the initial physics code. 


__1/4/20__ Emma:

Made initial draft of the basic physics code. Was able to get particle to move in all four directions, and accelerate using jerk.
