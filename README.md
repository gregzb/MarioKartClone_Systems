## Description
We will be making a top-down version of a game similar to Mario Kart where we plan to implement kart racing with decent graphics, collisions, typical game logic, and networked multiplayer, with four concurrent players supported. As a stretch goal, we will aim to adjust the graphics so that they are psuedo-3D in the style of the SNESâ€™s F-Zero and Super Mario Kart.
