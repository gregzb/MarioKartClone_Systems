## Description
We will be making a top-down version of a game similar to Mario Kart where we plan to implement kart racing with decent graphics, collisions, typical game logic, and networked multiplayer, with four concurrent players supported. As a stretch goal, we will aim to adjust the graphics so that they are psuedo-3D in the style of the SNESâ€™s F-Zero and Super Mario Kart.

## How to Use:
Start the game by running make, and make run. The menu will display.

### To play Single Player:
Click single player. Your kart will be spawned and you can control its direction using the WASD keys. The A and D keys will rotate your kart while the W and S keys will allow you to move forward and backwards. <INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS OF EXACTLY HOW YOU WILL BE PLAYING>
 
 ### To play Multiplayer: 
 Have one person click the start "Create Multiplayer," while all other players click "Join Multiplayer." A countdown will appear on the screen and when it begins, the game will start. Each player will be spawned on a track, and in order to win the game, they must complete one round around the track. They will each be able to move using the WASD keys (similar to the single player version), collide into walls and into other players. <INCLUDE FURTHER DESCRIPTION>
