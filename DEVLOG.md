SAMPLE LOG:
__1/[date]/20__ [NAME]:

[WHAT DID YOU DO?]


__1/15/20__ Darius:

Integrated networking into game logic, added base state management. Removed debugging, fixed connect to server.


__1/15/20__ Greg:

Added text rendering. Added the click variable. 


__1/14/20__ Darius:

Integrated networking into game logic, added base state management. Removed debugging, fixed connect to server.


__1/13/20__ Darius:

Added boilerplate and notes for Sunan. Ran formatter and fixed a return value after server.main. 


__1/12/20__ Darius:

Added function prototypes. Added networking integration. Use pipe rather than signals, changed countdown code. Moved networking code from server.c Merged code. 


__1/12/20__ Greg:

idk.


__1/11/20__ Darius:

Finished initial version of server game start code. Fixed spin_time and printf formatting. 


__1/11/20__ Greg:

doot.goot. Some refactoring, added level type, added level struct, Made the Kart rotate around the ship. 


__1/8/20__ Greg:

Worked on the collision generator. Refactored SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING. Update py collision code.

Merged incoming and local. Completed skeleton of potential networking protocol and skeleton of future code with server_main. Added. Mr. DW's boilerplate.
